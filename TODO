- npm init
- get db calls running
  - columns for main info
    - hostname, path, map, num_visits, num_unique_visits, last_visited,
  - REST api:
    - axios on the js side to put together info we want
      - at first is just a plain call where the server knows what to do
      - handler that takes in this data
    - middleware on the server side to grab all site visits (for a given hostname?)

- git pull for weaponized police
- table UI
- better place for this directory to live?
